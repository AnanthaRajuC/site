import Sprite from '~/components/Sprite'

I've worn different hats on a diverse range of projects in Banking &amp; Financial Services, Legal &amp; Compliance, Document Processing and Aviation domains. This includes work on ETL, frontend, site reliability and backend.

Besides writing code, I draw vector illustrations and read fiction (mostly sci-fi and fantasy). I like exploring languages and have an avid interest in typography. I prowl the web for shiny new tools to tinker with. In a social setting, you'll find a kindred soul in me if you're interested in movies, pop music, Urdu poetry and books. I'm also a pretty good listener.

### About this site

This site started out as a pet project for me while learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It helped me get my bearing around Vue.js community, accessibility, web performance and more.

A lot of the posts here are tutorial-style notes that I'd documented to demonstrate a concept or process for my colleagues and myself. They serve as a reference of what I've learned, and a source to receive ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback. The code described in the examples is meant for the demonstration of the topic under discussion; please apply caution and common sense before using it in an actual application.
